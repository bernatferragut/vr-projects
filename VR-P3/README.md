**##VR-Maze**##

* Build a Maze. 
* You land from the air and have to find the exit.
* To do so you need to find a key to unlock the final door to the exit.
* You move by gazing and waypoints to teleport to different points.

> A game style experience where we experiment with movement, speed and teleport in VR.

## Maze Experiment accomplishes:

0. Play with physics attched to the Main Camera
1. Move between autowalk and teleport to see the potential effects combining both at the same time
2. Inclusion and experimentation with waypoints to move between certain places where crossing is difficult
3. Apply game logic to go from place to place and taking objects to open doors
4. General Sound / and object especific inclusion
5. Simple Interaction.
6. Fun to play and really immersive because of the maze proportions
7. A positive first moving experience inside VR 
8. Important feedback that gives as important clues about how to approach the next projects
