**##VR-Maze**##

* Build a Maze. 
* You land from the air and have to find the exit.
* To do so you need to find a key to unlock the final door to the exit.
* You move by gazing and waypoints to teleport to different points.

> A game style experience where we experiment with movement, speed and teleport in VR.

## Maze Experiment accomplishes:

0. Play with physics.
1. Move between autowalk and teleport
2. Inclusion nd experimentation with waypoints to move in certain places.
3. Apply game logic to go from place to place.
4. Sound inclusion
5. Simple Interaction.
6. Fun to play and really immersive because of the maze proportions
7. A positive first moving experience inside VR!
