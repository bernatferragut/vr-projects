> VR-Architectural **LOFT**

  * Modelling of a real LOFT in Central Montreal / Canada
  * Light Baking of the scene  generating LightMaps
  * 3 Scenes: Intro in the corridor / First level / Mezzanine and Terrace
  * Slow movement to appreciate the space and select the 'items' you like into a mini DataBase.

> The idea is to immerse the person into a 'real measures' loft and to give the possibility of Like/Dislike certain
items and parts of the loft. Once the person has visited upstairs and downstairs we can see which are the objects
that he/she liked and the ones he/she disliked. It's a first attempt to use a mini realtime DB in VR.

> We accomplish:

  0. Presence
  1. Real life measures of the space
  2. Simple Baking of shades and colors
  3. Interaction with the objects saving results to files
  4. A final result of the 'likes/dislikes' list
  5. Movement between levels through Waypoints
