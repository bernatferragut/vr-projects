**##VR-Planets**##

* Build a complete earth planetary system to scale . (excluding the Sun's real scale)
* Give the right movements and speed to the different planets.
* Insert a camera between Mars and the Moon, rotating with the earth as the Camera View point.
* From there we can have a good sense of scale and presence within the universe in VR.

> By putting simply the camera in a 'strategic position' we can acieve great immersion in  percieveing the movement and beauty 
of the Solar System. (Here comes my experience in real cinematography in place)

## Planet Experiment accomplishes:

0. Insert real textures to the scene.
1. Create sort of photorealism .
2. Inclusion of camera effect LensFlare when looking at the sun.
3. We can see which planet we are looking at when gazing over through a script.
4. Great Immersion.
5. Simple Interaction.
6. You can have real feeling of the distances and proportions of the different planets.
7. More than a game is a learning experience.
